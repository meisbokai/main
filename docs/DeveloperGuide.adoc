By: `CS2113T-AY1819S1 Team F10-1`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialogue first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing, Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level3`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the new features added on from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook-Level 3] by se-edu by reading <<Implementation>>.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::Exam[]
=== Exams Feature
[[fig-ExamDiagram]]
.Class Diagram of the Exam feature
image::Exam.png[width="600"]

==== Current Implementation
There is a master ExamBook which contains all the exams. There are several features the ExamBook offers.
The main features are:

. `Adding a new exam`
. `Deleting an exam`
. `Editing an exam`
. `Registering a person for an exam`
. `Deregistering a person for an exam`

Changes to the master ExamBook will affect the corresponding exams in the AddressBook. This is done through iterating through the AddressBook to update the change. Changes in the AddressBook will also affect the exams the persons registered for in the ExamBook and hence, for other persons in the AddressBook. This is also done through iterating.

An Example of how feature 5 - `Registering a person for an exam` works:

. First, the specific exam and person will be identified from the most recent exams and persons listing respectively.
. The specific exam and person is then extracted out of the ExamBook and AddressBook respectively.
. A check is performed to ensure the specific person is not already registered for the exam.
. A new exam is created to keep a copy of the original exam.
. The exam has its number of exam takers increased by 1.
. The exam is added to the specific person.
. For the AddressBook, any copies of the original exam are removed and replaced with the new exam.


This is demonstrated by the following sequence diagram:
[[fig-registerPersonDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of registering a person for an exam with no errors occurring
image::RegisterExam_Sequence_Diagram.png[width="1200"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the exam data are being synchronised between the AddressBook and ExamBook

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each time there is a change in the field of an Exam, there has to be iteration through the whole AddressBook or ExamBook to update them.
** Pros: Less space is needed.
** Cons: This can waste some time if no changes need to be made for example.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the persons registered for an exam for each exam.
** Pros: This makes it faster to update any changes in both AddressBook and ExamBook if needed.
** Cons: More data is duplicated and stored in both AddressBook and ExamBook.

===== Aspect: How the exam data are being updated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each time there is a change in a field of an Exam, a new Exam is created with the new details and added into the ExamBook and the old Exam is deleted from the ExamBook.
** Pros: To enable good synchronisation between the AddressBook and ExamBook as the old hash key is removed and a new hash key is added.
** Cons: Temporary increase in space for the object created during the method.
* **Alternative 2:** Edit the original exam directly.
** Pros: Easy access to set values.
** Cons: To check if an exam exists for a person, there needs to be iteration and checks using the equals() method due to different hashing, increasing time.

===== Aspect: Exam equality

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The current equals() method does not check for full equality.
** Pros: This is used when there is not a need to check for full equality, such as when adding a new exam to the ExamBook.
** Cons: Another method is needed to check for full equality.
* **Alternative 2:** Have the current equals() method check for full equality, with no extra methods.
** Pros: Fewer methods and easier to understand implementation.
** Cons: Duplicate exams can be added, especially after modification of an exam in the ExamBook.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the exam commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Exams are stored in a set under each Person object in the AddressBook but stored as a list in the ExamBook.
** Pros: In the Exambook, it is required to access an exam through an index to delete and edit, hence list is better. In the AddressBook, exams are only to be used for viewing and accessed to check for the value. It takes O(1) time to check for existence and remove and add.
** Cons: Exams stored under each Person in the AddressBook cannot be sorted.
* **Alternative 2:** Exams are stored as a list in both ExamBook and AddressBook.
** Pros: Exams stored under each Person in the AddressBook can be sorted.
** Cons: It takes O(n) time (longer time) to check if a Person has a same Exam with the Exam to be updated.

===== Aspect: Storage of ExamBook

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Exams are stored in a separate txt file from AddressBook
** Pros: This allows for clarity and easy access to find and see exams in raw XML format.
** Cons: Extra storage file and hence methods and file paths are needed, this may be confusing and cause much repetition of code.
* **Alternative 2:** Exams are stored in the same data file as AddressBook.
** Pros: Only 1 storage file is needed. Less repetition and variables are needed.
** Cons: Might be harder for the user to see exams in raw XML format as everything is stored together.
// end::Exam[]

// tag::privilege[]
=== Privilege/Account Feature
The Privilege feature aims to only restrict the user's interaction to their allowed commands, while the Account feature provides a means for the user to authenticate himself/herself to access more commands.

---

The figure below shows the class diagram describing the implementation of the Privilege/Account feature.
[[fig-PrivilegeDiagram]]
.Class Diagram of the Privilege Component
image::PrivilegeClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

==== Current Implementation

* *Logic* is assigned to one *Privilege* object at all times. *Privilege* contains a *User* (specified by the *PrivilegeLevel* enum) and a *Person* (referred to as `myPerson`). +
* The *User* interface describes the different <<privilege-level, *Privilege* level>> an user can have, which is implemented by *BasicUser*, *TutorUser* and *AdminUser*. +
* *BasicUser* is the class with the lowest access level, and the ancestor to other 2 *User* classes. +
* To create an increasing level of access, each *User* of a higher level inherits from the successively lower one. +
* *User* levels have their own list of new commands they can run, which is appended to the list inherited from their parent. +

* *Account* class, which contains its respective *Privilege* object as well as login details, assigns a *Privilege* level to a *Person*. +

An example of how `logging into an account` works:

. First, the *Command* will retrieve the *Person* with the specified username, which is gotten from *AddressBook* who receives it from *UniquePersonList*.
. The *Command* then validates that the specified password matches the password the *Account* belonging to the retrieved person.
. If the password is correct, the *Command* will update the *Privilege* level(`user`) and its *Person*(`myPerson`) to match that of the *Account*.
. Finally, the *Command* retrieve the *Name* of the *Person* in a string format to be printed as part of the feedback message.

Step 2 is illustrated in the Object Diagram below.

The Sequence Diagram below gives an overview of the process involved in logging into an *Account*

[[fig-LoginSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram for Login Command
image::Login_Sequence_Diagram.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to define a privilege level of Privilege

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Instantiate *User* objects of the different access level. *Privilege* contains an enum *UserType* which point to each of these instantiated objects.
** Pros: Allow us to make use of inheritance to organize the list (higher access level *User's* list of allowed *Commands* will always be a superset of that of a lower access level). +
The usage of enums also allows us to keep a reference to the created *User* object, which allows us to point back to these object if need be, rather than having to instantiate new ones each time.
** Cons: Requires the use of *User* class to represent the different access levels
* **Alternative 2:** Use an enum to indicate the current access level. List of allowed *Commands* will be generated base on the value of this enum.
** Pros: Does not require a separate class to represent the different *Privilege* levels.
** Cons: Difficult to maintain the list of allowed *Commands*.
* **Alternative 3:** Use a String to determine the *Privilege* level.
** Pros: Easy to implement and parse.
** Cons: Very prone to undetected bugs, like misspelling the *Privilege* levels.

===== Aspect: How to define the required *Privilege* level of *Commands*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each *User* holds a list of *Commands* they can run
** Pros: Easy to maintain the list of available *Commands* for a given *User*.
** Cons: Difficult to find the required *Privilege* level a *Command*, as it requires looping through the list to find the presence of the given *Command*.

* **Alternative 2:** Each *Command* knows what access level is required to run it
** Pros: Easy to find what access level a *Command* requires
** Cons: Difficult to see the *Commands* available to a given *User* can run, thus making it hard to organize the *Commands* by their required access level.

* **Alternative 3:** Have both 1 and 2
** Pros: Doing both the above operations become easy
** Cons: Difficult to maintain both information. The required *Privilege* level for *Commands* will be stored in 2 separate locations and needs to be in sync.

===== Aspect: How to update the *Privilege* of *Logic* when logging into an *Account*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The *Privilege* object attached to *Logic* will copy the *User* and the *Person* attached to the given *Account* object, into its own variables.
** Pros: Does not require the *Command* to interact with *Logic*, thus reducing coupling.
** Cons: A bit more awkward solution than the Alternative 2
* **Alternative 2:** Make *Logic's* variable to point to the new *Privilege* object inside of Account.
** Pros: Quick to implement.
** Cons: Has a higher level of coupling compared to Alternative 1. Also, would require storing or instantiating a default *Privilege* object and making a *Logic* point to this new object if *Logout Command* were to be called.

===== Aspect: Default required access levels for *Commands*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Required *Privilege* level is set to Admin by default
** Pros: If a developer forgets to assign a required *Privilege* level to a *Command*, it will to still be functional.
** Cons: May mask the fact that the *Command* has the unintended access level of Admin, which is a minor drawback.

* **Alternative 2:** Enforce all *Commands* to be assigned an access level
** Pros: Forces developers to be deliberate with their access level assigned to *Commands*.
** Cons: Program will fail to integrate if any of the developers forgot to assign an access level to their newly developed *Command*.

===== Aspect: Who throws InsufficientPrivilege Exception

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** *Logic* throws the Exception
** Pros: It is a common starting point of commands, so it is easy to implement it to throw the Exception
** Cons: Blurs the responsibility of *Commands* being the one throwing Exceptions

* **Alternative 2:** Each *Command* checks the *Privilege* level during execute()
** Pros: Keeps to the responsibility of *Commands* being the one to throw the Exception.
** Cons: Requires backdating all *Commands* to include this function in their execute(). Also prone to errors as a developer may forget to call this function in their execute() of their newly developed *Command*.

* **Alternative 3:** Have a function that checks the *Privilege* level in parent command that is called during execute()
** Pros: Same as **Alternative 2**.
** Cons: Same as **Alternative 2**, but instead of using individual functions, we are repeatedly using the inherited function instead
// end::privilege[]

// tag::Grades[]
=== Grades Feature

==== Current Implementation
There is a master StatisticsBook which contains all the statistics for various exams. There is also a list of assessments
and the grades for these assessments being stored in the AddressBook. The current set of commands include:

. `Adding a new assessment`
. `Listing all assessments`
. `Deleting an assessment`
. `Adding grades for a student`
. `Viewing all grades for a student`
. `Deleting a specific grade for a student`
. `Adding statistics for an assessment`
. `Listing all statistics`
. `Deleting a statistic`

This is the class diagram for the assessments, grades and statistics combined:
[[fig-AddAssessmentDiagram]]
.Class Diagram
image::AssessmentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

. A list of unique assessments can be stored in the addressbook.
. Each assessment object contains a Hash Map, with Person as the Key and Grades as the Value. Hence, the grades of all
students for a particular assessment will be stored together in the same HashMap.
. Each person object (or student) can have a list of assessments and respective grades under it. This makes sense
logically since a student will have multiple assessments throughout the school year.
. Statistics can be added for an existing assessment. The grades stored in the HasHMap will be used to calculate various
stats such as average score, total exam takers, max score and min score.
. This list of statistics is stored in the statisticsbook.

An Example of how feature 2 - `Adding a new assessment to the AddressBook` works:

. The user (teacher/ admin) will be able to use the 'addassess' command to add a new assessment.
. This assessment will only be added to the Address Book if it is not already present. i.e. check for duplicate assessments
is done.
. These assessments reflect the exams/homework of the school in general. This list of assessments can then be used to add
  grades to a particular student.

This is demonstrated by the following sequence diagram:
[[fig-AddAssessmentDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of adding a new assessment
image::Assessment_Seq_Diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: 'Assessment' and 'Grades' as separate classes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Assessments and Grades are created as two separate classes. Assessment class stores the grades of all students for that assessment in a HashMap, where the Person (or student) is the key.
** Pros: Better design in terms of OOP. Allows easier calculation of statistics per assessment as you can simply loop through all the grades. It is also a good model of the real world where all grades for an assessment will be stored together.
** Cons: This is a little more tedious in terms of coding.
* **Alternative 2:** The Assessment and Grades are combined into a single class with different parameters to take in the exam name and grade respectively.
** Pros: - Storage of the data becomes a little easier and you can just store a list of grades added to each person.
** Cons: Cannot view the list of assessments separately. This architecture does not make sense in terms of modelling how grades are stored in the real world.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store grades
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The grades are stored using a Map data structure under Assessment class
** Pros: Allows easy reference to person class.
** Cons: Cannot sort/ order the entries if required.
* **Alternative 2:** The grades are stored using a 'List' data structure under Assessment class
** Pros: Can sort the grades alphabetically if required.
** Cons: Difficult to link grades to person.

===== Aspect: Creation and Storage of Statistics Book
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate Statistics Book is created to store the statistics of all assessments. Also, these statistics are stored in a separate txt file (statistics.txt) from AddressBook
** Pros: These assessment statistics have no direct link to the person object. It is a separate set of information accessible to all users (students, teachers and admin). Hence, a separate Statistics Book provides increased clarity and makes sense in terms of the end-usage. This also gives easy access to find and see statistics in raw XML format.
** Cons: Using an extra storage file implies that additional methods and file paths are needed. Makes code lengthier and repetitive.
* **Alternative 2:** Store statistics in AddressBook itself.
** Pros: Everything is condensed and can be found in the same spot. Also, only one storage file would be needed.
** Cons: It is messy and confusing in terms of implementation - Unrelated data is being stored together.

===== Aspect: Automatic calculation of statistics
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A fixed set of statistics (average score, the total number of exam takers, max score and min score) are automatically calculated inside the application itself.
** Pros: Reduces human effort. Makes the process of creating a statistic easier for the user as they would not have to use any external tools like Excel to do this.
** Cons: Only the statistics parameters currently built into the app can be added. If the user wants to add any other parameter like pass rate, then it is currently not possible.
* **Alternative 2:** The user manually calculates statistics using given data by hand and enters it in the app to store.
** Pros: The user can choose to leave some field blank if wanted.
** Cons: Extremely tedious. Against the whole point of digitizing the school management as manual paperwork is still involved.

==== Aspect: XML Storage of Assessments and Grades
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Two concurrent lists are used to store the person index (as per latest person list) and respective grades for each assessment.
** Pros: Since each student only has one grade per assessment, it is practical to store them as lists. Essentially, the keys of the hash map (in index form) and the values are stored as two separate lists. The corresponding pairs can be obtained by reading the entries at the same index in both lists.
** Cons: This is an adaptation of the HashMap used to store grades in the code.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the grades as a list of pairs (person index and grade value) for each assessment
** Pros: Storage is more coherent.
** Cons: Code is lengthier and more strenuous to write.
// end::Grades[]

// tag::Fees[]
=== Fees Feature
[[fig-FeesDiagram]]
.Class Diagram of Fees
image::FeesClassDiag.png[width="800"]

Fees are an additional field to every `Person` object:

. Each Person will have a Fees object
. Fees contain both a String value as well as a String duedate
. Users can thus check the Fees of a particular person, or list out all the fees of the Persons in the address book

==== Current Implementation
An attribute under the Person class is initialised when a Person is added to the AddressBook. This attribute holds 2 Strings, one being the monetary value of
the fee and the other being the duedate for that respective fee. The current set of commands include:

. `Editing a Fee`
. `Paying a Fee in full`
. `Viewing Fee of a Person`
. `Listing all Fees`
. `Listing all Due Fees`

An Example of how command 1 - `Editing the Fee of a Person` works:

. The admin will be able to use the 'editfees' command to add a new fee to the Person.
. The existing fee with its date will be replaced by this new value in the Person object in the AddressBook.
. The updated fees will then be stored in the AddressBook and will be automatically private, only viewable by the admin and tutors.

This is shown in the diagram below.

[[fig-EditFeesSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram of EditFeesCommand
image::EditFeesSequenceDiag.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to define a Fee for each Person
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Instantiate Fee attribute under each Person created in the Person Class.
** Pros: Allow us to skip the need for another data Class to be saved into any of the storage files, therefore being more convenient and reducing the number of files and Books. +
** Cons: May get messy with more data manipulation of the Fees attribute when printing/sorting.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a separate date file 'FeesBook' to keep track of each Person and their respective fees.
** Pros: Data independency and hence no conflict during data manipulation.
** Cons: Cluttered as there may be too many data Books just to track an attribute.
* **Alternative 3:** A compulsory attribute under Person Class hence occupying a data field in the input for AddPersonCommand.
** Pros: Easy to implement and parse.
** Cons: Input for Add Command would be too long as it will have too many data entry points.

===== Aspect: Paying a fee for a Person
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate command for Admin to indicate a Person to have paid fees fully.
** Pros: Convenient for admins to control Fees data of each Person. +
** Cons: May seem redundant for 2 Commands to change the attributes of Fees.
* **Alternative 2:** Using EditFeesCommand to indicate the payment of Fees when edited back to 0 value.
** Pros: Lesser commands in the Fees feature, therefore lesser clutter.
** Cons: Counterintuitive as Admin would have to manually edit values to be "0.00".

===== Aspect: How to List fees of everyone
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shallow copies the internalList of ReadOnlyPerson, sorts the copy with a custom comparator and prints the list,
showing only name and fees.
** Pros: Allows for easy sorting and does not manipulate the date in the original internalList.
** Cons: Does not allow for any data manipulation such as omitting any Person
* **Alternative 2:** Looping through internalList and printing every name and respective Fee.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unable to be sorted by the date dues of the Fees of each Person.

===== Aspect: Having another ListDueFeesCommand
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Having another Command which only shows the people that have Fees that are due with respect to
the current system date.
** Pros: Clearer presentation of data and specific Persons involved. Ability to add "feesdue" tag to only the people shown.
** Cons: May seem redundant as these people already appear at the top of ListFeesCommand.
* **Alternative 2:** Merging it with ListFeesCommand, therefore only have one List Command with respect to Fees.
** Pros: Less clutter of code.
** Cons: Inability to show the list of Fees of the Persons whose Fees are not yet due. Restricted in presenting data.

===== Aspect: Using ViewFeesCommand with respect to INDEX
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Follows the other ViewCommands with respect to the last INDEX presented following any List Command.
** Pros: Coherent code template as all ViewCommands follow the INDEXED structure. Ability to be flexible depending on which List Command was
called beforehand.
** Cons: May not seem intuitive to view Fee of a specific Person if User only knows Name of the Person, therefore leading to use of the Find
Command first.
* **Alternative 2:** Using another parameter such as Name of the Person, instead of INDEX
** Pros: More intuitive to layman Users.
** Cons: There may be Persons with identical names, thus resulting in conflicts in ViewCommand.
// end::Fees[]

// tag::attendance[]
[[attendance]]
=== Attendance Feature
[[fig-AttendanceDiagram]]
.Class Diagram of the Attendance feature
image::ClassDiagram_Attendance.png[width="800"]

[[fig-AttendanceDiagramWithMethods]]
.Class Diagram that links from UniquePersonList to Attendance object, including methods
image::ClassDiagram_Attendance_with_Methods.png[width='800']

The attendance field is an additional field to every `Person` object:

. Each `Person` will have an `Attendance` object
. Each `Attendance` object will contain a Hashmap, which will store the attendance of each person by keying each String `date` to a boolean `isPresent`.
. `UniquePersonList` will contain 2 lists, containing a list of people who are present or absent for each particular date.
. Users can thus check the attendance of a particular person, or for a particular date.


==== Current Implementation
The AddressBook contains the attendance of each person for each date that his/her attendance is taken. The current set of commands include:

. `Updating a person's attendance`
. `Replacing a person's attendance`
. `Viewing of a person's attendance`
. `Viewing of present people on a particular date`

An example of how feature 1 - `Updating a person's attendance` works:

. The user (teacher/ admin) will be able to use the 'attendance' command to update the attendance of a particular person (student).
. The specific person is extracted from the Addressbook.
. A check is performed to check if the person already has his/her attendance taken.
. If the attendance has already been taken, the user will be prompted to use another command `replaceAtten` to replace the attendance.
. If the attendance has yet to be taken, the attendance of the specified person for the specified date will be taken as either 'present' or 'absent'.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store attendance for each person
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Each person has a hashmap that stores the date to the attendance.
** Pros: Hashmaps allows more efficient checking of duplicate attendance (get() method has a complexity of O(1).
** Cons: Values and Keys in hashmap are not sorted.

* **Alternative 2:** Each person has a list of strings containing the date and attendance.
** Pros: A list of strings will allow easier storage and viewing of the data
** Cons: List or ArrayList will require O(n) time to check for duplicates
** Cons: A single string will not allow handling of data separately

* **Alternative 3:** Each person has a list of pairs containing date and attendance.
** Pros: Pairing of date to attendance ensures that the checking of attendance requires at most O(n) time, but minimally O(1)
** Cons: Usage of pairs in java will require an extra class or an external library, which is unnecessary

===== Aspect: How to check if attendance has duplicate
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use a boolean to check if there is a duplicate date in the hashmap.
** Pros: Booleans only have 2 value, and thus there is no need to define a string with a proper variable name
** Cons: Booleans are fixed as true and false, thus needed additional code to translate the result into a string so that the user can understand the results easily.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a separate class, 'hasDuplicate' to check for duplicate date
** Pros: An additional class means that the code will be more encapsulated, fulfilling the purpose of OOP.
** Cons: Additional code will be required to create the additional class

===== Aspect: How to differentiate between updating and replacing a person's attendance
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Using an additional parameter (Boolean overWrite) that is fixed in the command.
** Pros: No confusion for the user since the parameter to overwrite is fixed.
** Pros: THere is no need to have 2 separate methods in the Attendance object as both updating and replacing of attendance has very similar functions.
** Cons: There is a need to check for an additional parameter in the same method, which may lengthen the code and cause minor 'arrowhead' coding.

* **Alternative 2:** Treat the 2 commands as 2 completely separate commands and execute them individually.
** Pros: The 2 commands will each be short, simple and easy to understand.
** Cons: There will be 2 methods with extremely similar functions, which is redundant.

* **Alternative 3:** Have the user input an additional parameter (Boolean overWrite) if they want to overwrite the current data
** Pros: Similar to alternative 1, having the user input an additional parameter and only having 1 method in the Attendance object can reduce the need to have unnecessary duplicates in the code.
** Cons: An additional parameter will require a change in the parser.

===== Aspect: How to store data in XML, addressbook.txt
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use 2 list to store a list of dates and a list of absent/present
** Pros: Simple implementation, and utilizes the fact that each date can only have either present/absent. Iterating through the map to generate the 2 lists will thus ensure that the data is in order
** Cons: In the XML format, data will be stored as 2 separate lists, which may not be as user-friendly to edit directly.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a list of pairs, Pair <String Date, Boolean isPresent>
** Pros: Only requires 1 single list to store the data of the entire map.
** Cons: Such implementation will require a Pair object, which will require additional methods and classes, thus requiring longer code.

* **Alternative 3:** Convert Hashmap to XML directly
** Pros: Direct transfer of data will thus require less memory space to store the same data.
** Cons: A Hashmap to XML converter will require either a very long code (unnecessary for only 1 map), or requires the import of an external library.

==== Coming in v2.0
===== Aspect: : How to implement `multiAtten` Command
* **Alternative 1 (Most likely choice):** `multiAtten` command calls the `attendance` command multiple times
** Pros: Reduce the need for repeated code since the multiAtten command is very similar to attendance command.
** Pros: Simpler to implement when the input is 0 as there is no need to catch index 0 since index 0 will not exist in the UniquePersonList.
** Cons: Increase in coupling as a change in `attendance` command will cause `multiAtten` command to change.

* **Alternative 2 (Unlikely choice):** Reimplement the command as a brand new command
** Pros: Cleaner codes
** Pros: A brand new implementation would allow for future upgrades
** Cons: Lengthier and repeated code

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting the document to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in web pages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in the link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

=== Types of tests

We have 3 types of test:

.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.commons.UtilsTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.storage.StorageFileTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.logic.LogicTest`

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changed to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/Main.java[`Main.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
