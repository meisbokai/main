== PROJECT: ClassRepo

---

== Overview

ClassRepo is a desktop address book application written in Java that targets secondary schools for usage by their students, tutors and staff. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a very basic GUI. This portfolio is meant to document the contributions that I made to the project.

== Role

I served as the projectâ€™s bug tester, to ensure that each feature added will be as bug-free as possible. I also became a point of contact should any of my group's members require technical help in developing their respective features and participated in group discussions.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Exams feature*
** What it does: allows staff to create and manage exams held in the school, as well as registering students for them. 
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because exams would be present in every school and it would be valuable for the staff to manage them in a single application. Students would be able to benefit as they can check their exam schedules without the need to ask others or record them separately.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
