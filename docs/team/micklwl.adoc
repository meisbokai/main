== PROJECT: ClassRepo

== Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio is to document the specific contributions I have made to this project. The project was carried out over the course of one semester in the National University of Singapore(NUS), under the module CS2113T, which aims to teach Software Engineering principles and Object-Oriented Programming. ClassRepo was done by a team of 5 including myself.

== Project Overview

ClassRepo is a desktop address book application written in Java that targets secondary schools for usage by their students, tutors and admins. It serves to integrate all the functionalities that the user would need in their seconday school lives and/or school operations.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a very basic GUI. It is an enhanced version of the AddressBook Level-3 application by the sed-edu team.

== Role

I served as the projectâ€™s bug tester, to ensure that each feature added will be as bug-free as possible. I also became a point of contact should any of my group's members require technical help in developing their respective features and participated in group discussions.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=micklwl[here]

* *Main feature implemented*: added the *Exams feature*
** What it does: allows staff to create and manage exams held in the school, as well as registering students for them. 
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because exams would be present in every school and it would be valuable for the school tutors and admins to manage them in a single application. Students would be able to benefit as they can check their exam schedules without the need to ask others or record them separately.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands, data structures and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and data structures. This is because a single exam object is closely related to the whole AddressBook. Hence, there are checks to ensure that the exams are always synchronised in both storage files.
