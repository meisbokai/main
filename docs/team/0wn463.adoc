== PROJECT: ClassRepO

== Overview

ClassRepO is a desktop address book application written in Java that targets secondary schools for usage by their students, tutors and staff. This portfolio is meant to document the contributions that I made to the project.

== Roles
Under this project, I serve as the Project Lead, monitoring the merger of Pull Requests and ensuring the master branch is clean and free of bugs. I also took it upon myself to set up the project's environment (tools and improved codebase), so that the other members of the team can have a easier time developing this product. 

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: 

==== *Privilege* and *Account Features*

* What it does: Restricts available user interactions based on what privilege level they are currently hold. Accounts allow users to authenticate themselves so as to access more commands.
* Justification: This feature helps fufil the requirement of having different types of user interacting with the system. This creates some form of structure within the system, giving the users access only to the commands that they will need.
* Highlights: This feature weaves itself into all the commands implemented, which demands careful modification to each of them as to ensure no bugs arise from regression.

=== *Minor enhancement*:
* Updated code of AddressBook-3 to fulfil the Learning Outcomes expected, to provide a good base to start the project on.
