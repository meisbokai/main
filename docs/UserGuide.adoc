== Saving the data

Data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually. Address book data, exam book data and statistics book data are saved in files called `addressbook.txt`, `exams.txt` and `statistics.txt` respectively in the project root folder.

== Handling Errors

1. ClassRepo does not start up when running the jar file. +
*Plausible cause*: `addressbook.txt`, `exams.txt` or `statistics.txt` contains invalid data. +
*Solution*: Fix the data error in the problematic file. +
Refer to `log.txt` to find the underlying error. +

2. ClassRepo shuts down mid-operation. +
*Plausible cause*: `addressbook.txt`, `exams.txt` or `statistics.txt` was set to read-only during
a data saving operation. ClassRepo shuts itself down to ensure synchronisation of AppData and storage data. +
*Solution*: Ensure that the data files are not set as read-only. 

== Known Issues
1. ClassRepo ASCII art may be formatted wrongly on OS's such as Mac.
